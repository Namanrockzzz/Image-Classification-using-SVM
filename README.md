**Concept of Multiclass SVM:**
- Dataset used contains 202 images of Cats, Dogs, Horses and Humans each.
- Datset can be found on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/eabdul/dogs-cats-horses-humans-dataset/discussion">link</a>.
- This project contains Implementation of multiclass SVM from scratch.
- Accuracy can be increased by varying value of c i.e. coefficient of penalty.
